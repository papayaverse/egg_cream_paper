# Papayaverse White Paper Draft
#### Ram M. Kripa

## The Problem

The way enterprises handle consumer data is broken.
After over 4100 data breaches in 2022 affecting more than 500 million people, it's clear that there as a few problems in this space.

+ ***Lack of control and ownership***: Consumers have limited control over how their data is collected, used, and shared by companies.
+ ***Data breaches and cyber attacks***: As more data is collected and stored electronically, the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks increases, putting consumers' personal and sensitive information at risk.
+ ***Privacy violations***: Companies collect and use consumer data for purposes that are not disclosed to the consumers or go beyond what they have consented to.
+ ***Monopolistic practices***: A few companies control a significant portion of the data market, leading to concerns about their power and influence over consumers and competition.

## The Solution

The optimal solution to these problems, in my opinion, is to put consumer data back where it belongs- in the hands of consumers.

In October 2022, for my final Data Ethics essay, I wrote a piece on this linked [here](https://www.papayaverse.com/post/of-cookie-monsters-and-men-the-war-for-data-privacy).

It elucidates the the need for personal data bank, thereby enabling the creation of a fully decentralized data exchange, and a new data economy in which the users generating this data are active participants.

It was from these ideas that [Papayaverse](https://www.papayaverse.com) was born. It aims to be a new kind of institution; a Data Bank.

Papayaverse will be responsible for storing users' digital assets in a decentralized, secure, and easily accessible system, while also enabling them to monetize these assets through data exchanges.

## Technologies

The creation of such an institution would require two key technologies: 
1. A Decentralized Data Storage Platform
2. A Decentralized Platform for Asset Exchange and Payments

I believe we have found those in Solid and Blockchain, respectively.

### Solid

Solid is an open source web data decentralization project started by Tim Berners-Lee and researchers at MIT.
Papayaverse uses the solid protocol to provision data pods (Personal Data Stores) for our users, a decentralized data store linked to the user's identity.
While this technology is of great value, it does not implement payments or a mechanism of recording data exchange and access grants.

More information on Solid can be found here:

2. [Sir Tim Berners-Lee's statement on Solid](https://www.inrupt.com/blog/one-small-step-for-the-web)

### Blockchain

Blockchain and NFT have become bad words in the past year due to their association with high profile scams and monkey-related gimmicks.
However, they serve key purposes in the Papayaverse project:

1. Creating an indelible record on the blockchain of users sharing their data.
2. Decentralized payments platform.
3. Fairly compensating users for allowing companies to access to higher quality de-anonymized first party data if they choose to share it.

Additionally, the [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/blockchain-sustainability-platform) blockchain, on which the Green Papaya smart contracts are deployed, is a carbon neutral chain.

## Papayaverse Data Bank

With these technologies, the Papayaverse Data Bank allows users to:

+ ***Storage***: Store and manage personal data securely.
+ ***Control***: Decide who gets to access their data.
+ ***Transact***: Get paid for sharing data with companies.
+ ***Derive Additional Value***: Benefit from customized experiences based on their data.

## Inrupt Hackathon

Papayaverse was entered into the Inrupt Solid Hackathon with a friend in April 2023 and based on this submission, I was invited to speak at (SolidMcr)[https://www.manchesterdigital.com/event/solidmcr/solidmcr-005-developing-with-solid-and-where-to-start]. 
During the two week hack, I implemented a rudimentary version of the Data Bank API. Here is the [link to the Demo Video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZygS-IFWmmc)
